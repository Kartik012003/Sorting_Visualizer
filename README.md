sorting Visualizer
                                      
A web-based application that visualizes various sorting algorithms, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a dynamic, graphical representation of the sorting process.

Features
Interactive Interface: Easily visualize sorting algorithms with an intuitive UI.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Adjustable Array Size and Speed: Change the number of elements and the sorting speed.
Random Array Generation: Generate a new array of random elements at any time.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS3: Styling and animations for the visual elements.
JavaScript: Logic for the sorting algorithms and user interactions.
